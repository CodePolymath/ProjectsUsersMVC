Challenge: Developer Blackbook

**Description:**

Your challenge — should you choose to accept it — is to create a credential blackbook. A lean app that keeps track of projects and their respective credentials. This app should allow us to accomplish the following objectives:

* Add projects with a name and a description

* Add, edit, list, and delete credentials under each project with name, description and all fields required by the credential type.  Ex. SSH has host, username, password, and port, but a website may only have a username and password.

With the above information think through, plan and execute using any programming language, frameworks and libraries you feel best to create this project in the least amount of time based on the requirements below.

**Time:** 

Please make this app as lean or robust as you would like, and we estimate the core functionality to take within 20 hours. "Finishing" this app is not a requirement but would be a bonus. Our goal is to primarily see decisions you would make as you put together this project.

**REQUIRED:**

* Environment Setup

* Data Storage

* Sample Data

* API

* Web Page/App

* Forking this project into a private bitbucket repo

**Bonus:**

* User Registration/Login

* Sharing of credentials with other users

* SQL solution

* Object Oriented code (back-end and front-end)

* An API with a RESTful architecture

* Web App is styled and pleasing to look at

* Web App is responsive

* Web App uses data modeling for API endpoints

* Web App is AJAX-y (one-page js app)

* Minimal wheels re-invented

* We are WOW’ed

**Deliverables:**

* URL to the working app

* Update the README file with the following:

    * Installation instructions if needed

    * Instructions on how to use the app

    * An explanation of what you did and why for all aspects of the application preferably with time spent on all the various aspects development (including research time).
